# odin-calculator
The Odin Project Foundations Course Final Project

### TO DO:
 
 - Basic calculator functions: add, sub, mult, div
 - variables to update the display
 - operate function
 - basic html calc with buttons for each digit and operator including =
 - display
 - clear button
 - functions to populate display when clicking buttons
 - make calculator work

 #### Keep it simple first
 - not evaulate more than single pair of numbers. Evaluating 2 numbers displaying the result, the result should be the next operand
 - clear should wipe data
 - snarky message for trying to divide by 0

 - when a result is displayed pressing a new digit clears the result and starts new calculation

 #### Extra credit
 - add decimal button but disable it if there is already a decimal separator in the display
 - backspace button
 - keyboard support
